I grew up near Boulder, CO and spent most of my childhood reading books, playing music, and playing video games. I learned programming by making bad games for my TI-83 calculator. The first things I published online were bad flash websites.

In college I studied programming and human-computer interaction. A team of classmates and I made [a few apps](http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/These-Stanford-Students-Made-Millions-Taking-A-2361888.php) on Facebook, which eventually turned into a startup. This was the first time I made something that was used by a large number of people. It became my introduction to making real products that have users and make money.

In 2010 I started working for [a mobile game company](http://en.happyelements.com/) as the first employee in its new Japanese branch. At first I was in charge of localizing and publishing browser-based games to the Japanese market. Eventually we grew enough to start making our own games locally, and I transitioned to being a game designer. 

I consider myself very fortunate that the products I've worked on have been used and enjoyed by so many people. In the future I want to continue creating things that have a large impact on people, and I hope to focus more on doing work that makes the world a better place.

Since my day-job doesn't currently involve much programming, I like to work on [fun projects](/projects/) on the side that let me build things directly.
