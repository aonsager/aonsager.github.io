I have a background in web development, and have been making mobile games in Japan since 2010. I enjoy solving problems and creating things that people enjoy using.

### Projects

[Pokemon fusion](http://pokemon.alexonsager.net)

A simple website to show the results of a script that replaces heads and swaps colors in Pokemon sprites.

[Check My Wow](http://www.checkmywow.com)

A website (currently discontinued) that will analyze World of Warcraft combat logs and give targeted feedback specific to the type of character you were playing.
