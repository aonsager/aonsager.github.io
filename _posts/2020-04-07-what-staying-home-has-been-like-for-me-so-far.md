## Things that changed

- I have more time in the morning to do things around the house instead of commuting
- Remote meetings are a little harder than in-person meetings
- I write daily reports about my work progress, equally to show my teammates that I’m staying on track, and to keep myself on track
- We watch the news a lot more
- I don’t wear socks
- Pushing my social life online has lead to me talking to friends more than before

## Things that didn’t change

- Waking up in the morning is hard
- Work hours are mostly the same, or a little longer from the lack of a commute
- There is still a lot of work to do and I am busy
- I still shave and brush my teeth and shower
- I get dressed in the morning
- We get groceries delivered once a week
- The world is stressful, but being able to stay at home is a blessing so total stress balances out
- The dog doesn’t seem to care that I’m around
