<p>The other day, a woman asked me if I could spare some change for poor women and children, and my automatic response was to keep walking with no response. Then, as I was walking away she called out to me and said &ldquo;God bless you.&rdquo; Hearing that made me feel like an awful person, because I certainly didn&rsquo;t do anything to deserve it. It was on my mind for a while after that.</p>
