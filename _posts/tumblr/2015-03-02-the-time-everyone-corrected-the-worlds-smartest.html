  <p>In 1990, Marilyn vos Savant correctly answered a probability puzzle in her column for Parade Magazine. And then, the world called her an idiot.</p>

<p>I still remember the chaos caused by the Monty Hall problem in our high school math class. Here&rsquo;s my explanation for how it works:</p>

<ul><li>Your first choice could either be a goat or a car.</li>
<li>If you picked the car, you will win the car by not changing your guess.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s a goat, you will win the car by changing your guess.</li>
<li>Since you&rsquo;re twice as likely to have picked a goat than a car, you&rsquo;ll be twice as likely to win by switching for your second guess.</li>
</ul><p>Note that picking a goat and changing your guess will guarantee the car, since the host has revealed the second goat.</p>

<p>The best strategy is to <em>try to pick a goat</em> in round 1, and plan to switch once the host has revealed the second goat.</p>
