<p><u><b>The Documentary Type</b></u></p>
<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/weinstein/whereintheworldisosamabinladen/trailer/" target="_blank"> Where in the World is Osama Bin Laden?</a> - Before you write this movie off as one that sounds like it was done by those guys that make stupid teen movies (I almost did), go watch the trailer. It&rsquo;s done by the guy who made Supersize Me, and chronicles his quest to find Osama Bin Laden. And the trailer plays Gogol Bordello music.</p><p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/planetbboy/trailer/" target="_blank">Planet B-Boy</a> - A documentary on the breakdancing culture. This movie looks awesome.</p><p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox_searchlight/youngatheart/trailera/" target="_blank">Young at Heart</a> - A group of elderly people in New England sing covers of great rock songs. This is a must-see.</p>
<p><u><b>The Artsy Type</b></u></p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/lovesongs/trailer/" target="_blank">Les Chansons D'Amour</a> - I&rsquo;m really excited about this one. Three people are each in love with the other two and have a fascinating relationship. French musicals ftw. </p><p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/thevisitor/trailer/" target="_blank">The Visitor</a> - College professor with a ho-hum life accidentally meets a young couple, and his life gets turned around when as they become friends. This movie looks really good.</p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/miramax/smartpeople/trailer/" target="_blank">Smart People</a> - The trailer didn&rsquo;t impress me all that much, but I really want this movie to be a good one. I&rsquo;ll keep my fingers crossed.</p><p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/theyearmyparentswentonvacation/trailer/" target="_blank">O Ano em que Meus Pais Saíram De Férias</a> - A Brazilian boy is taken in by his Jewish grandfather&rsquo;s neighbor (?) when his parents are exiled. I can&rsquo;t put my finger on it, but something about this movie really appeals to me. </p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/backseat/trailer/" target="_blank">Backseat</a> - Two guys go on a roadtrip to get away from life and have wild antics along the way. This movie will probably either be really good or pretty dumb, so I hope for the former. </p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/paramount_vantage/sonoframbow/trailer/" target="_blank">Son of Rambow</a> - A movie about two boys filming a movie. It wowed the crowds at Sundance, and I think &ldquo;delightful&rdquo; would be a good word to describe it. They asked us to help promote the movie through Graffiti, and I wish we could&rsquo;ve :(. </p><p><b> </b><u><b>The Exciting Type</b></u><b> </b></p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/romandegare/trailerb/" target="_blank">Roman De Gare</a> - Follows the stories of three people, who may not be exactly who they claim to be. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is going to be a thriller, but it seems pretty exciting, and clever. I&rsquo;m excited to see Dominique Pinon.</p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/magnolia/flawless/trailer/" target="_blank">Flawless</a> - I love bank robbery movies! This one stars an unlikely duo trying to pull an inside job. </p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/spiral/trailer/" target="_blank">Spiral</a> - I personally will not be watching this, but if you&rsquo;re into creepy, disturbing horror movies then this one&rsquo;s for you.</p><p><u><b>The Funny Type</b></u></p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/priceless/trailer/" target="_blank">Priceless</a> - Huzzah! Another rockstar French cast. It&rsquo;s a remake of Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s, and it looks like it won&rsquo;t disappoint. That, and I love Audrey Tautou.</p><p> <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/universal/forgettingsarahmarshall/large.html" target="_blank">Forgetting Sarah Marshall</a> - 40 Year Old Virgin? Knocked Up? Superbad? Yeah, their new one is coming out. Go watch it. </p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/youdontmesswiththezohan/high.html" target="_blank">You Don&rsquo;t Mess with the Zohan</a> - I haven&rsquo;t been excited for an Adam Sandler movie in a while, but this one sure does look fun.</p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/newline/bekindrewind/large.html" target="_blank">Be Kind Rewind</a> - A movie about Jack Black making movies? Heck yes! </p>
