<p>I still remember the chaos caused by the Monty Hall problem in our high school math class. Here's my explanation for how it works:</p>

<ul><li>Your first choice could either be a car or a goat.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>If you picked the car, you will win the car by not changing your guess.</li>
    <li>If you picked a goat, the host will reveal the second goat. The last door left will be the car, so you are guaranteed to win if you change your guess.</li>
  </ol>
<li>You have two possible strategies to win the car:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Try to pick the car on your first guess, and don't change the guess.</li>
    <li>Try to pick a goat on your first guess, and change the guess after the host opens another door.</li>
  </ol>
<li>The second strategy is better, since picking a goat is twice as easy as picking the car.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best strategy is to <em>try to pick a goat</em> in round 1. Once the host has revealed the second goat, you are guaranteed the car by switching doors.</p>
