## Concept

Play Pac-Man online against other players. 1 player plays as Pac-Man and 4 other players play as the ghosts. Pac-Man's goal is to collect as many dots as possible, and the ghosts' goal is to work together to catch Pac-Man. Players receive points at the end of the round based on performance, and roles are rotated for the next round.

## Gameplay

In terms of strategy, the ghosts will need to work together in order to win. Pac-Man will move faster than the ghosts, so the ghosts' main strategy will be to trap Pac-Man in a corner. To encourage teamwork, all ghosts will receive the same amount of points at the end of round regardless of who actually caught Pac-Man.

The fact that the ghosts can share information makes the game much harder for Pac-Man than the original, so he needs a new advantage too. We allow Pac-Man to see the entire map, but the ghosts can only see a small radius around them. The ghosts' vision is shared with each other, so together they can see a large portion of the map. 

The game then becomes a hide-and-seek game, where the ghosts spread out strategically to try to find Pac-Man. Pac-Man hides from them for as long as possible while collecting dots along the way. If the ghosts find an area with no dots, they will know that Pac-Man has already been there. Once Pac-Man is spotted, the ghosts converge on his position and Pac-Man must try to escape before becoming trapped.

With the gameplay changes, the characters should be changed as well. Some other ideas are:

- A squirrel collecting nuts vs. 4 wolves
- A thief collecting coins vs. 4 policemen with flashlights
- A human looking for supplies vs 4 zombies
