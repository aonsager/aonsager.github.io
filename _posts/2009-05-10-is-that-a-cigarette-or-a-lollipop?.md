I saw a girl at a bus stop who appeared to have a cigarette in her mouth. "Yuck," I thought. Then, I realized it was a lollipop. I immediately wanted to become her friend.

You see, there is something special about lollipops. As far as your mouth is concerned, you could just as well be eating a normal hard candy. But the stick makes a worldâ€™s difference. You are proclaiming to the world, *"I am enjoying a candy."* There is no way to be inconspicuous about eating a lollipop. You have committed to this act, and do so with no shame.

And anybody who feels such passion for candy is all right in my book.
