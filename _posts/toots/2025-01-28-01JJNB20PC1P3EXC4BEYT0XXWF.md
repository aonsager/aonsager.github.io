<p>Is there a best way to update a static blog from my phone?<br><br>Opening the blog repo in a text editor and pushing to git will definitely be too much friction for me to do regularly.<br><br>I want to just be able to just write text, save/send it somewhere, and have my home PC (I guess?) process it for me.</p>
