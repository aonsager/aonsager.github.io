<p>I've been really enjoying the slow pace of joining the fediverse. Find a few interesting people to follow, see who they interact with and slowly branch out connections from there.<br><br>In networks with algorithmic feeds, you're presented first with EVERYTHING, and are tasked with filtering out what you don't want until you have a nice curated space. It's stimulating by design, but a little overwhelming. Conversely on the fediverse, you start with NOTHING and slowly add content you like.<br><br>Everything is a preference for sure, this just feels so refreshing to me.</p>
