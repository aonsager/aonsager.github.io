<p>I've added my pronouns to my profile.<br><br>I hadn't before, because my pronouns weren't important to me. I've learned, though, that this is because I am privileged.<br><br>For many people, their pronouns are very important. And, unfortunately, there are many who are openly antagonistic towards these people. So it's important for people like me to be openly supportive, to balance the scales if you will.<br><br>"I support your rights to feel however you want to feel about yourself" feels like such a ridiculous thing to say. In a sane world we would never *need* to say that. But look around, guess what. We do need to say it, and we need to say it loudly. So I will.</p>
