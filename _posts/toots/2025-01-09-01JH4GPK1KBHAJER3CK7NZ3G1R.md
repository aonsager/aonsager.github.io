<p>An analogy:<br>I join a social network with the goal of building a space that I like, out of lego pieces.<br><br>The fediverse slowly gives me a few pieces at a time, and I choose what I want. I slowly build out a nice lego structure.<br><br>Networks with algorithmic feeds dump me in a room full of legos, and say I have my pick. Most pieces aren't what I want, and a good number are even broken. I spend most of my time sifting through pieces, looking for something I can work with.</p>
