<p>I was pretty optimistic about moving my entire personal site to Quartz, but there are a lot of little nags that make it not great for a blog format.<br><br>No support for pagination, and lots of little issues with RSS are the main ones. Gotta admit that Jekyll just handles it much better.<br><br>Quartz is probably best used for exactly what it says: to transform a folder of assorted Markdown files into a functional website. I think I'll keep my blog as-is, and add Quartz as an auxiliary personal wiki.</p>
