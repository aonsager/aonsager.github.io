<p>I have all of these ideas for glorious things I can write. I can see them in my head, touch them even, right there just waiting to be let free.<br><br>But then I have to actually physically *push* the thing through these crusty pipes that make up my mind. And it does not come out, and I just keep pushing, and pushing.<br><br>And now here it is, this goopy pile in front me, and it isn’t beautiful at all, and the viscosity was gross to touch.<br><br>But I guess then I pick it up again, and work at it a little, and try keep the original glorious image in my mind as much as I can. And eventually, it becomes something ok. And that’s just how it is.</p>
