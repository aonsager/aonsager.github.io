The white-spotted pufferfish, or Amami hoshizora fugu, is a species of pufferfish newly discovered in 2014 near Japan's Amami-Oshima Island. The males spend roughly a week constructing an elaborate circular nest about 2 meters in diameter to attract females. 

Divers had known about these structures that appear in early summer every year, but apparently it took a while to catch the fish in action.
