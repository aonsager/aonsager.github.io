> The Nintendo Switch is designed to be portable, so it doesn’t have a disc drive. Instead, its games come on cartridges, just like games for Nintendo’s handheld platforms stretching back to the original Game Boy. But there’s something different about Switch cartridges: *They taste awful*.

> Update (March 2): In a statement emailed to Polygon, a Nintendo representative confirmed the theory that Switch cartridges are coated in a material that’s meant to dissuade people from putting the units in their mouths.

So Nintendo actually takes special steps to make their cartridges taste terrible, to keep people from swallowing them. That's an attention to detail that I hadn't even considered before.
