blurb: I love the IQUNIX Magi65, but did not enjoy the NuPhy Air75. I'm now curious
  about split keyboards but have been resisting buying one so far.
---

I use an [IQUNIX Magi65](https://iqunix.com/products/magi65) keyboard at home, and absolutely love it. I didn't get the Pro version, as I don't really need a dial or media keys, and I preferred the smaller size anyways. The only real criticism I noticed in reviews was that the keyboard is pretty heavy, but this turned out to be a good thing for me. I don't want to carry the thing around with me, and I love the solidity as I type. The typing experience is fantastic.

I wanted a nice keyboard at work, too, and felt weird about buying 2 of the same keyboard. I figured this was a good opportunity to try something else, so I got the [NuPhy Air75 V3](https://nuphy.com/collections/keyboards/products/nuphy-air75-v3-page) for the office. This was also well-reviewed, and is quite a bit lighter. It seems like people who want low-profile mechanical keyboards also value portability, which makes sense.

I've been giving it a fair chance, but I have to admit that I really don't like it very much. For lack of a better vocabulary, the keys just feel too light. I find myself mistyping a lot for some reason, and I think it has to do with the keys being pressed very easily without a lot of bounce-back. Maybe I just have to learn to be gentler with my typing? I'm not sure, but it's been a while and I still haven't gotten used to it.

Then, I came across the [Toucan](https://shop.beekeeb.com/products/toucan-wireless-piantor-wireless-split-keyboard-with-touchpad), which is just absolutely gorgeous. I had never really considered a split keyboard, but I fell in love with this one.

I still haven't bought one. I'm worried about losing so many keys, but this has definitely triggered an interest in split keyboards, and the [Corne layout](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) especially. I can't justify getting this as a daily driver, or spending so much money on a side-toy, but I'm been browsing used markets for a cheap entry model. Who knows, maybe one day I'll find The One and dive off the deep end.

So what about my work keyboard? I might just get another Magi65, because it is by far my favorite typing experience.
