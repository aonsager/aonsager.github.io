blurb: Joining the fediverse, digging into writing and programming as a hobby, and learning to keep a physical journal.
---

Nothing much has changed for us in these past few years, and that is by design. Work is stable, life is stable, everybody is happy. I am very thankful for that.

Last year I set up [GoToSocial](https://gotosocial.org) on my personal server to join the Fediverse, and that has been a lot of fun. It's nice to be social on the internet again. I think this has helped motivate me to update this site more, and I'm having a lot of fun making little updates to the site as well.

AI tools have been super useful for programming as a hobby. It has made it so much easier to finish and ship my little projects, and I have already developed a slew of little utilities that I use often. I'm still writing words by hand though, because I think being able to organize my thoughts into communicative sentences is such an important skill.

I also started keeping a physical journal at the beginning of this year, and one month is the longest I have ever kept up the habit so I am hopeful that it will continue. I had always admired people who keep physical journals; I thought it was a wonderful habit. I never could get into it though, and had resigned myself to thinking that I just wasn't that kind of person. But my wife convinced me that if that is the kind of person I _want_ to be, then it's worth putting in the effort to make the change. So far, I am really enjoying it. I'm using the most simple interpretation of [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com). It's turning to be a super helpful framework to guide the kinds of information I should keep, and the format for recording it.
