A chilling story told by a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay. I hope that someday we'll look back and wonder how anything like this could have been possible.

> I’ve been detained at Guantánamo for 11 years and three months. I have never been charged with any crime. I have never received a trial.  
> [...]  
> The situation is desperate now. All of the detainees here are suffering deeply. At least 40 people here are on a hunger strike. People are fainting with exhaustion every day. I have vomited blood.  
> And there is no end in sight to our imprisonment. Denying ourselves food and risking death every day is the choice we have made.  
> I just hope that because of the pain we are suffering, the eyes of the world will once again look to Guantánamo before it is too late.
