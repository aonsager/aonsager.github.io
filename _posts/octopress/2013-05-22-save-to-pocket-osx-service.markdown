Here's a quick Mac OSX service that will allow you to save any link to Pocket by right-clicking it. It will work from within basically any app that lets you right-click text. Prerequisite is that you have the Pocket OSX app installed.

[Download the script here](http://images.alexonsager.net/downloads/SavetoPocket.zip)

After downloading, unzip and place the file in ~/Library/Services (or create the folder first if it doesn't exist already)

After doing so, you should be able to simply highlight a link and right-click it to see the "Save to Pocket" option. (You might find it under a "Services" category)
