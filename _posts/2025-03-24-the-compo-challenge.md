blurb: I had a great time participating taking photos as part of The Photo Composition
  Challenge. This is a recap of my experience, and shots taken.
---

I am a mediocre photographer at best, but of course I want to improve. When I saw that [@hiro](https://social.lol/@hiro) was putting together 5-week challenge to experiment with various compositional techniques and share our photos, I had to join.

I don't have fancy gear, or a lot of time to go hunting for photos, so almost all of my shots were scenes from my daily life, taken with an iPhone. I realized pretty quickly though, that being deliberate about composition gave a new perspective on even familiar scenes, and I was surprised at compelling some of the photos turned out.

## Week 1: The Rule of Thirds

> The Rule of Thirds challenge is all about getting your subject out of the middle of the frame.
> Imagine your frame is divided into three equal segments from left to right, and then again from top to bottom, creating a 3×3 grid. Try to place your subject along one of the lines dividing the thirds, so it’s not squarely in the middle third. 


This was a rule I was aware of! I even had the overlay turned on in my Camera app to divide the view into thirds, so now I just need to be deliberate about the positioning.

The third photo here is my favorite. It is from our kids' bedroom, and I'm happy that I was able to capture it like this.

## Week 2: Leading and Diagonal Lines

> Leading lines are lines within the frame of your shot that naturally draw the viewer’s eye to your subject.
> Diagonal lines [. . .] create a sense of movement and tension [. . . and] can also enhance depth, adding a more three-dimensional quality to your composition.

This may have been my favorite exercise. I learned that I really like the aesthetic of leading lines, but unfortunately couldn't find many good subjects myself. This will be something that I will continue to look out for!

I like the third photo here, again. I thought it would be neat to get a thin view of the sky between two tall buildings, and found the perfect spot. Then I spun the picture around in an editing app to find just the right claustrophobic angle. 

## Week 3: Frame Within A Frame

> Whereas Leading Lines used lines within your photo to point to the subject, this technique asks you to find ways to create a frame around your subject in your composition

I had a hard time finding good subjects again, and 2/3 of my frames ended up just being long corridors. But they are cool shots!

## Week 4: Subject Isolation + Contrast

> [Contrast] could be very visual by putting a brightly lit subject against a dark background, or color based by contrasting a bright red rose against green foliage, or even conceptual with something like capturing someone who is clearly quite happy on a bus surrounded by dour fellow passengers.

I was surprised that this exercise was the hardest for me. I tried not to rely on just using bokeh to highlight the subject, and it was hard to find things that just naturally stood out from their surroundings. Not only was I tardy in finishing this week, I only managed to take two photos that I was happy with. So it goes.

## Week 5: The Golden Spiral

> [The Golden Spiral is] about arranging the elements in your photos along the lines of an imaginary spiral, so that it offers an easy and natural flow for the viewer to follow those elements to your subject.

{% include image.html image="2025/golden_spiral.png" description="The Golden Spiral" %}

In practice, this ended up being an exercise in imagination as much as photography, as finding subjects that lined up to this mathematically perfect spiral was pretty challenging.

The spaceship photo is probably the one that follows the spiral the closest, and the your eyes naturally flow in the same direction, too. The photo itself could have been better, but that's what learning is for.

## Wrapping up

And that's all! Thank you a hundred times to Hiro for organizing this! I had a wonderful time taking photos, as well as seeing everyone else's submissions. If there is a next time, I will definitely be joining again.
