But it's just not doing it for me.

Federation is a very strong selling point, and I tend to agree with [Tim Bray's points](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/11/15/Not-Bluesky) that some kind of decentralized, protocol-based network for social exchange is what will endure. Having one service being run by one group of people is brittle. Having many services run by many group of people is resilient.

A lot of people explain that Mastodon and the Fediverse is similar to email. You can make an account with any provider, and it lets you speak to anyone on a different service. You can have a gmail account, and send emails to a fastmail account.

But for me the analogy is not apt, mainly because of server rules and moderation.

## Moderation of Mastodon

Each Mastodon server has its own set of rules, and moderation guidelines. There are things you can't say
