I have been playing World of Warcraft on and off for about 10 years, but I decided to stop playing again about a year ago. I decided to stop because of a series of changes that were made to the game, and it motivated me to think about why I reacted that way as a paying customer.

Some recent changes to WoW were designed to motivate players to play by ensuring they always gain something and grow a little every time they play. Unfortunately, these changes made me feel like my time in the game was less valuable, and they ultimately led me to stop playing.

## What makes a subcription-based game worth its price?

All games need to convince people that the what they are buying (whether it's a complete game, an item, or another month of game time) is worth the price. [I wrote previously]({% post_url 2017-11-30-pay-to-win %}) about what mobile games do to make people want to buy extra items. Games with a subscription model, where players  pay a fixed amount every month, have a very different strategy. Unlike games that sell items, they don't need to maximize revenue per user because everybody pays the same price. Instead, the most important metric is how many people will keep playing the following month. In fact, the total revenue per user is determined by how many months they spend playing the game. 

Traditional console games need to convince people to pay money just once. "$60 will get you more than 100 hours of fun gameplay!" On the other hand, WoW and other MMOs need to convince people to pay money **every month**. One thing that helps people decide is whether they felt like the previous month was worth the price. So games do their best to make sure that people are always satisfied with the time they have spent playing the game so far. 

## How to design a subcription-based game

Most online games follow a basic progression system that can give players a fun game experience over a long period of time. You enter a dungeon, beat a few bosses, and get a few strong items. The dungeons reset each week, and since those new items are making you a little bit stronger you can get a little further in the dungeon. After a few months you are strong enough to defeat the final boss, and by that time the game will (hopefully) soon release a new dungeon. You always have a challenge, and you are always making progress towards completing the challenge. It's almost like you're buying and playing a new small game every few months, but it's much more meaningful because you keep the same character who is constantly growing stronger.

So then, what can go wrong and make people want to stop playing?

## People pay for their time. Don't make them waste it.

If you played for many hours and killed many bosses but never managed to get a new strong item because you were unlucky, all of that time would feel lost because you gained nothing substantial for your effort. At the end of the month players will ask themselves, "Did I get my money's worth last month?" If you spent $15 that month to play a game but didn't make any progress, you might feel like that was a waste of money.

So WoW started to reward people for the time they spend playing the game. Now you will constantly get special experience points when you play, and this will make your items stronger. Because you are always gaining these experience points it is guaranteed that none of your time will be a total waste. People can spend more time playing the game and be satisfied that it was time well-spent. Problem solved, right?

Not quite.

## People pay for their time. Don't devalue it.

The issue is that if every hour you spend in the game makes you stronger, you are now required to spend many hours playing the game if you want to be strong. Before, I could play for a few hours on the weekend fighting bosses and if I was lucky I would get some great items and be a strong player. Now having the good items isn't enough. I'm required to make my items stronger by spending many more hours gaining extra experience points to improve them. 

In that sense, the time I spend fighting bosses is only meaningful if I also spend more time making the items stronger. And what if I can't because I'm too busy the rest of the week? My time spent in the game, which hasn't changed, is now worth less because I get less benefit from it. I now feel like I'm no longer getting my money's worth from the game. And ironically, the cause was a new system designed to make every hour spent in the game be more valuable. 

## What would be better?
