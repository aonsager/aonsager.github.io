_This is by no means a new idea, but I wanted to put it down in my own words._

On average, you are more likely to be satisfied by a service for which you directly pay money. This is because paying money makes you a customer of the business, and the business is thereby directly motivated to keep you satisfied.

If you want to find a service that will satisfy you for a long time, _paying a subscription_ is your best bet.

Here are some facts:

1. In general, a business aims to please its customers.
2. A business's customers are _those who pay it money_.
3. If you do not pay money to a business, you are not its customer.

## The case of venture-backed companies

For a venture-backed company that provides a free service to its users, its customers are its _investors_, not its users. Of course, the investors want the company to become successful (whatever that means), and a service's success _usually_ depends on having satisfied users, so the goals aren't _too_ detached. But when push comes to shove, the direct motivation placed on the company will be to satisfy its _customers_ over its users.

So on average, in the long term, the motivation of the company will drift away from your needs as a user. This leads to a gradual degradation of the perceived quality of the service, and a growing dissatisfaction among its users.

For example, Facebook used to provide excellent ways for people to share information about their personal lives and keep up to date with their friends and family. Now, it is focused more on increasing engagement for its users — which is what its customers (investors) value — and no longer has any focus on keeping people connected.

## The case of a one-time cost application

You are paying for the application, so you are the customer. Right? Well, almost. At least you are at first.

As a _business_, the developer needs to continue to generate revenue. Who are the customers it needs to please this month? Those people who _are buying the app for the first time this month_. The developer needs to understand what needs are going unmet _now_, and deliver a solution for those needs. If the needs of potential customers shifts significantly over time, so too may the offerings of the application shift.

For example, popular to-do tracking apps used to just be focused on personal task management. Later, the industry as a whole shifted towards offering solutions for collaborative team management. More recently, everybody wants smart AIs to do smart things for them, so many apps are placing AI functionality front and center. The app that you loved and bought 5 years ago may very well be a very different app today.

Of course, a lot of apps have pretty static use-cases and don't change that dramatically. But you see what I mean.

## The case of a subscription-based service

I think this model gives a service the best chance of continuing to please its users.

The users are always the customers. If the users ever become too displeased, they will just stop paying for it. The business is always directly motivated to keep its users happy — especially the most loyal ones who have been using the service for a long time.

For example, [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com) asks its customers to pay a monthly fee to use its search engine. This is pretty shocking for anybody who is used to having search as a free feature of the internet, but —

There always seem to be people lamenting that Google's search results are not good, are not as good as they used to be. It's hard to qualify how true this actually is, but it's definitely plausible. Deep down, the most important thing for Google is not how easy it is for users to find the things they're looking for. The most important thing for Google is that Google generates money from its advertisers. Of course, Google needs a consistent, very large number of satisfied users in order for that to happen, and so the two needs are not _too_ disconnected. But they are not the same, and it's possible — likely, even — for priorities to have drifted apart.

But in the case of Kagi, if a users feels that search quality has declined, they will just stop paying. Because their search quality declined, they will make less money. In order for Kagi to make more money, they have to make search quality better. By adopting a subscription model, Kagi has fundamentally aligned the goal of the service with providing excellent search.

This is why a subscription-based service is the most likely to keep its users satisfied over time, and why — if you care, and if you have the choice — you should choose to use a subscription-based service over other offerings.
