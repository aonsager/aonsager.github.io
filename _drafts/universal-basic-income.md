On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs [https://strikemag.org/bullshit-jobs/].

Steve Hughes, "Why do we work, everything's built already" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4-3TKy2A28]

The Alaska Permanent Fund [https://www.businessinsider.com/alaska-universal-basic-income-employment-2018-10] has been giving $1000-2000 to every citizen since 1982. It's tied to oil revenue, and was set up as the Trans-Alaska Pipeline was being finished in 1977. 

In general it's working very well, and hasn't increased unemployment or made people more lazy.


As our society improves and we get more efficient, it makes sense to imagine a future where we don't have to work as much. Robots and machines can do a lot of work for us. It should be apploauded, but is feared instead. We can't live without money, and we can't get money unless we are productive members of society. Capitalism is set up to make us want to stay busy.

Universal basic income seems like a natural solution, and probably is necessary in some form if want to make life easier.

On the other hand, capitalism promises rewards for great work, and that's what motivated a lot of people to do great things. People spend millions of dollars researching medicine because a breakthrough drug could be worth billions. Redistribution of wealth will take away from those rewards, and a loss in motivation might lead to a decline in innovation.
