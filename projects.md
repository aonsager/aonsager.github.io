Since my day-job doesn't currently involve much programming, I like to work on fun projects on the side that let me build things directly.

## This Site

Starting from a basic Jekyll template, I've added a number of customizations that I'm pretty pleased with.  
I should write a blog post going through them.

## Pokemon Fusion

A simple website that replaces heads and swaps colors in Pokemon sprites.

- Blog posts: [Behind the Scenes]({% post_url octopress/2013-06-04-behind-the-scenes-pokemon-fusion %}) and [Missingno.]({% post_url octopress/2014-08-10-missingno-in-pokemon-fusion %})


## Check My Wow

A website (currently discontinued) that analyzes World of Warcraft combat logs and gives targeted feedback specific to the type of character you were playing. I've published the source code but haven't put any time into cleaning it up.

## Squirrel 

A simple script that saves article text from a webpage into a local folder for archive and search.  
The full text of the page is searchable, which makes it much easier to find pages I half-remember.
