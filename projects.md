Since my day-job doesn't currently involve much programming, I like to work on fun projects on the side that let me build things directly. While I mostly make them for myself, a few have also become pretty popular.

## [Check My Wow](http://www.checkmywow.com)

A website (currently discontinued) that analyzes World of Warcraft combat logs and gives targeted feedback specific to the type of character you were playing.

The [source code is here](https://github.com/aonsager/checkmywow), but I haven't put any time into cleaning it up.

## [Pokemon Fusion](http://pokemon.alexonsager.net)

A simple website that replaces heads and swaps colors in Pokemon sprites. You can [read more about it here]({% post_url octopress/2013-06-04-behind-the-scenes-pokemon-fusion %}).
