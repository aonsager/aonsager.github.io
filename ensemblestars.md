[Ensemble Stars](https://stars.happyelements.co.jp) is a project I worked on at Happy Elements. I was the lead game designer for the mobile app released in 2015, which featured virtual teen idols and released episodic stories about their lives on and off the stage. Over the years it grew into a multimedia project that produced novels, comics, music CDs, live concerts, holographic concerts, and an anime show. We started as a game studio and ended up doing work not far from being a talent agency for virtual idols.

## The World of Ensemble Stars

The project takes place in a fictional world, focusing on a group of more than 40 teen idols who attend an all-boys school for future stars. The characters are divided into a number of idol groups, with various themes ranging from hard rock to techno-pop to superheroes. Each of the students has deep character development and rich backstories, which are revealed in episodic stories released via the mobile game. The students are each voiced by professional voice actors who also perform as the characters in official music CDs.

It isn't unusual for cartoon or virtual characters to have large fan followings in Japan, and fictional idols are no exception. Fans will buy CDs and attend concerts, performed either by prerecorded renderings of the characters or by the voice actors in person.
